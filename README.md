# BasicHTTPServer-With-Go-Lang

This repository demonstrates how to build a simple HTTP server using Go's standard library. Before running the program, ensure that Go is installed on your machine.

**To execute the program:**


```bash
cd SimpleHTTPServer/
go run main.go
```

This will start the HTTP server, allowing it to handle incoming requests. 
In order to check whether the server is working, we can simply check by this command:

```bash
curl http://localhos:Port
```
